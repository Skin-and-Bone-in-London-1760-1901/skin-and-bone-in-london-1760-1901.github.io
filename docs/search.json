    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nSkin and Bone aims to develop a new interdisciplinary approach by combining the expertise of archaeology and history with digital humanities methodologies. The methods applied in this project bring together those established in two completed projects: ‘Analysing Criminal Tattoos through Data Mining and Visualisation’, which developed data mining techniques and examined 75,000 tattoos on 58,000 convicts in Britain and Australia from 1793 to 1925 (2018-2019), and ‘The Material Body’ (2015-2018), which tested a range of collaborative methods by working on skeletal remains in Sheffield (1806-1855) and South Shields (1818-1855) with associated historical records.\nThe project has two main components:\n\nData extraction and classification\nSkin and Bone will reuse and merge ten existing datasets compiled from criminal records, hospital records, and osteological data that covers London, 1760-1901. London has been chosen as a pilot study due to the unique coverage, availability, and accessibility of the data for the period and an area where social and economic change was most pronounced. It will uncover hidden histories in the areas of risk, trauma, and the social, working, and domestic experiences of men and women, work, and the distribution of physical impairments over the life course.\nThe amount of processing required (and the amount and kind of information available) varies among the datasets. The osteological data is already highly structured, and the hospital data partly so. However, the physical descriptions in Digital Panopticon datasets often consist of undifferentiated and fragmentary language which can include various physical attributes (eg heights, scars, tattoos and disabilities). The relevant descriptive language needs to be identified, delineated and classified, but the datasets are too large in most cases for it to be feasible to mark them up manually. Instead, the project will build on and extend automated techniques developed for the Criminal Tattoos project. The Digital Humanities Institute, Sheffield, will be primarily responsible for the development work.\n\n\nData analysis and visualisation\nThe project will develop new methods for accessing the rich body of evidence on injury found in existing digitised data to create new and enhanced biographical information about individuals, their bodies and injuries to understand the impact of the Industrial Revolution on the body.\nOn this website I’ll experiment with data analysis and visualisation techniques in order to explore some of the project’s research questions. In addition to physical description, we have significant amounts of biographical information for many individuals, including gender, age, occupation, religion and criminal profile, and we’ll explore ways to use visualisation to summarise and analyse this evidence.\nThe methodologies developed for data extraction and visualisation will be transferable for analysing other types of diverse and disparate data found in historical and contemporary sources. The database will generate new findings, illustrate the potential for interdisciplinary work in this area, and will be a pilot for a larger, collaborative research project."

    "text": "Research Questions\nThe project addresses a combination of historical and digital humanities research questions.\n\nWhat does evidence of scars and injuries, and their locations on the body, taken from convict observations, hospital admissions, and analysis of skeletal remains, tell us about experiences of work-related injuries, accidents, and interpersonal violence in the eighteenth and nineteenth century?\nWhich individuals, and from which social contexts, bore scars and injuries? How did physical harm vary by gender, age, and occupation? And how did these patterns change between 1760 and 1901?\nHow do we classify and merge complex variables from social and osteoarchaeological datasets charting experiences of scarring and injury from skin (surface descriptions within hospital and criminal records) and bone (evidence of healed and/or healing trauma in skeletal remains)?\nHow can visualisations be utilised to summarise and analyse the complexity of this evidence, particularly when it is combined with evidence about the individual’s personal background and characteristics, in order to identify the specific contexts in which injuries, and what types of injuries, occurred?\nIn particular, can new data-mining and visualisation techniques be developed to uncover significant patterns in this and potentially other collections of complex, multivariate humanities data?"

Some of the data being used by the project is already publicly available from the University of Sheffield data repository. Datasets will be Creative Commons-licensed (or similar) for re-use, but the exact license terms are likely to vary."

    "text": "Skin and Bone seeks to chart the embodied experience of work-related injury, accidents, and interpersonal violence of c.170,000 Londoners during the Industrial Revolution. Led by a historian of the period, with expertise in digital humanities, and an osteoarchaeologist who has collated data on trauma and injury in eighteenth-century bodies, the project will generate a new open-access multivariate database and develop innovative approaches to studying and visualising the historic material body - skin and bone - in London during the Industrial Revolution.\nIn both archaeology and history, the period 1760-1901 represents a significant transformation for the body. Injuries, accidents and interpersonal violence profoundly affected lived experiences of the body in England during the intense period of industrialisation between 1760 and 1901. Osteoarchaeological scholarship has increasingly examined the negative impacts of the process of industrialisation. Historians, too, have discussed the impact of industrialisation on the body, specifically how new urban contexts damaged life expectancy while also changing attitudes to bodies that defined new social identities and social relationships, notably a new class of poor labouring bodies and hardening concepts of the able and disabled body.\nOsteoarchaeology datasets in combination with hospital and criminal justice records, which note age, gender and occupation alongside many bodily features (such as deformities and scars), provide a means of accessing and contextualising embodied experiences of industrialising London, but this information is currently held within disparate datasets. The project will merge ten datasets compiled from criminal, hospital, and osteoarchaeological records to explore the relationships between trauma, injury, and accidents with social demographics, but especially, sex/gender, age and occupational status.\nThe first technical challenge is to extract and classify detailed evidence on over 170,000 individuals, including their physical characteristics, bodily infirmities and personal details. The language used to describe injuries in the data is highly varied across the datasets, and it can be difficult to classify and standardise the nature of injury. In addition to the challenge of merging, extracting and classifying the data, a second technical challenge exists in coping with the complexity of the multiple variables available and in summarising such diverse data. In order to deal with this complexity, and examine the links between the datasets, new visualisations need to be developed to summarise this multivariate data."

Injuries, accidents and interpersonal violence profoundly affected lived experiences of the body in England during this intense period of industrialisation.\nLed by a historian of the period with expertise in digital humanities, and an osteoarchaeologist who has collated data on trauma and injury in eighteenth-century bodies, the project has created a new open-access dataset, which this blog will document, explore and visualise."

    "text": "Chronological overview\nThis shows the lack of overlap between most of hospitals’ data, which may make it difficult to talk about long term chronological patterns, as it could be muddied by possible differences between hospitals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince STH is very fragmentary and RLH only has three complete years, I’ll remove them from subsequent analysis to focus on the two hospital with good runs of full years, MXH and GHS.\nThere’s a lot of fluctuation, but MXH has mostly smaller monthly numbers. (Though why does MXH have a sudden large spike in numbers in 1774? That may need checking out. Also interesting that its numbers look higher before than after the gap in records 1765-71.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot of monthly admissions per hospital confirms much smaller numbers for MXH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninjury categories over time\nIs there any significant change in the distribution of injuries with which people are admitted over time?\nFiltering out a few categories that constitute &lt;1% of the total for each hospital; there are some differences between the two hospitals which I won’t investigate here. Eg, muscle = 6.6% of MXH but &lt;1% of GHS; injury doesn’t appear as a category in MXH but 35% in GHS. The former might be an actual difference in hospital intake; the latter is more likely a difference in recording practices.\nThe heatmaps are proportional rather than using raw numbers since there’s a lot of variation in category sizes. Even with the filters, some of the annual numbers could be very small. (White blocks in the heatmap = zero.) These are more likely to help with highlighting possible areas of interest for further exploration than to provide definitive findings.\nMXH heatmap confirms generally higher numbers 1760-64, before the gap in records, but also highlights certain categories in that period - dislocation, muscle and wound. After the resumption, distribution of injuries seems much more even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor GHS the distribution overall looks less variable than in MXH except for a possible surge in the wound category right at the end of the period."

    "text": "Seasonality heatmaps\nNB: This is not taking into account different length of months; 30 vs 31 days doesn’t make any visible difference, but needs to be borne in mind when looking at February.\nIf I want to combine the data for both hospitals in one chart, it’s better to do proportions than numbers again because of the differences.\nThe heatmap doesn’t suggest any major changes over time. But it does hint at a concentration of admissions in the middle months of the year, slightly more marked in the earlier MXH years (as well as one noticeable outlier that could would need further examination).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby hospital\nComparison of the two hospitals confirms the seasonal pattern is stronger for MXH than GHS, though it’s still present in the latter. In GHS, but not in MXH, December looks slightly more concentrated than the preceding and following months. (February is slightly exaggerated in both due to being a short month and if that’s taken into account it’d be much the same as Jan and March.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby gender\nComparison of gender highlights that the summer pattern is much stronger for men than women. Why would there be more female injuries in May?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(there isn’t enough age data to do the same chart for age groups.)\n\n\nby injury category\nA look at the four most frequent injury categories overall (excluding non-specific injury).\nSometimes a visualisation tells you something that hadn’t occurred to you but is obvious in retrospect: burns are most frequent in the late autumn and winter months (but why more so in Nov-Dec than in Jan-Feb?). The other three categories are on the whole following the summer months pattern, though fracture is… interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby body region\nAnd finally a breakdown for the four most frequent body regions (excl unknown). Again, tending to point to the summer pattern, but some more strongly so than others."

    "text": "Results\nPie charts are a bit controversial. But I like them in certain cases. They’re also really easy to make in {ggplot}. Essentially, you start by making a bar chart and then turn it into a circle using the coord_polar() function.\n\nAge groups\nI opted to use a sequential colour scale, which I wouldn’t normally do for categorical data, but age groups are a special case (since they’re based on numerical data and do go from low to high).\nI’d like to have consistent colours for these categories across analyses. With ggplot, the easiest way to have complete control of colours is to use the scale_*_manual() functions, with a paired vector. I can include all five groups (plus unknown) and ggplot won’t mind if some aren’t actually in the data; it’ll only complain if there’s a value in the data that isn’t included in the vector.\n\ncol_age_groups5 &lt;- c(\n  \"0-17\"='#ffeda0', \n  \"18-25\"='#fecc5c', \n  \"26-35\"= '#fd8d3c', \n  \"36-45\"= '#fc4e2a', \n  \"46+\"= '#800026', \n  \"unknown\"='#dddddd'\n  )\n\nAs you might expect of data based on skeletons from cemeteries, the largest group is the oldest. (But the younger groups are nonetheless considerably larger than they would be in a modern cemetery.)\n\nos_injury_ages |&gt;\n  distinct(person_id, age_group) |&gt;\n  filter(age_group !=\"unknown\") |&gt;\n  count(age_group) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)*100) |&gt;\n  mutate(ypos = cumsum(prop)- 0.5*prop ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=\"\", y=prop, fill=age_group)) +\n  geom_col(width = 1, color=\"white\", show.legend = F) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = age_group), position = position_stack(vjust=0.5), color = \"white\", size=4) +\n  # make it circular\n  coord_polar(\"y\", start=0, direction = -1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = col_age_groups5) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(plot.tag.position = \"top\" ) +\n  labs(tag = \"OS age groups\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the three collections, the 46+ group is a lot smaller in both HP and DP; in both cases, the age groups are more evenly distributed than in OS. In HP 46+ is clearly still the single largest group. In DP the largest group is 26-35, with 18-25 close behind, so pie chart critics might point out it’s not obvious which is larger. But I’d argue that’s fine, because the difference (about 3%) is too small to really matter. What I want to do is get a quick overview and comparison of the three collections, and that’s what this is good at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\nOnly OS has a significant proportion of unknowns. What’s most noticeable is that women are in the minority in all three collections - this would be expected in criminal datasets, but is more surprising in the other two."

    "text": "Methodology\nThe technical challenge is to extract and classify detailed evidence from more than 87000 descriptions of individuals, including physical characteristics, bodily infirmities and personal details. The language used to describe injuries in the data is highly varied across the datasets, and it can be difficult to classify and standardise the nature of injury.\nThe amount of processing required (and the amount and kind of information available) varies among the datasets. The osteological data is already highly structured, and the hospital data partly so. However, the physical descriptions in Digital Panopticon datasets often consist of undifferentiated and fragmentary language which can include various physical attributes (eg heights, scars, tattoos and disabilities).\nThe relevant descriptive language needs to be identified, delineated and classified, but the datasets are too large in most cases for it to be feasible to mark them up manually. Instead, the project builds on automated techniques developed for the Criminal Tattoos project.\nOutline of the process:\n\ntokenisation of the text (ie, break into individual linguistic units eg words, punctuation) and then classify each token using a dictionary prepared by the project team, to assign a type to each token: injury type, body part, body specifier (left, right, upper, back of), cause of injury [where possible], stop word (anything unrelated to an injury, such as boil, pockmark, or mole), separator.\na simple grammatical rule set is applied to the text in order to assign individual injuries to the correct locations on the body. The rules-based approach is augmented by training a spaCy relation extraction deep learning model.\n\nThe process is not perfect. The original text of the descriptions is retained in the injuries tables for reference, and anyone using the data is advised to take some time to understand the data and its limitations."

It’s already very structured so it’s easy to work with. However, it includes a relatively limited range of injuries (mainly fractures), constrained to those that can be observed on the skeleton. There is also limited background information (we don’t know exactly when people were buried). Both age and sex are determined from the skeleton itself.\n\n\nHospital Records (HP)\nAdmission Registers:\n\nMiddlesex (1760-64, 1771-88), c.6000 individuals\nRoyal London (1760, 1791, 1792, 1805), c.4000 individuals\nGuy’s (1813-39), c.70000 individuals\nSt. Thomas’ (1773-6, 1781-9, 1790-9, 1800-9), c.30000 individuals\n\nNotes:\nThe registers vary considerably both in terms of their survival and the amount of detail they recorded. In the best cases, there is valuable data on length of hospital stay and outcomes, as well as ages and occupations. But the largest registers have much less detail than this. Moreover, by its nature the data only records injuries that were severe enough to necessitate hospitalisation (and descriptions only record the specific injuries that occasioned hospitalisation). There is no “uninjured” population for comparison.\n\n\nCriminal records (DP)\nThree datasets from the Digital Panopticon:\n\nMillbank Prison Register (1816-1828), c.500 individuals\nHome Office Prison Licenses (1853-1889), c.6000 individuals\nMetropolitan Police Habitual Criminal Register (1881-1901), c.55,000 individuals\n\nNotes:\nThese can be extraordinarily detailed documents of bodily experience, all the more valuable because they have been linked to extensive biographical and criminal histories. But, as noted, the varied language of the descriptions is highly challenging for computational analysis and there will be many (though hopefully mostly minor) errors and omissions in classification, so the data should be used with care."

But they should work as a coherent set for our particular data.\nA few more categories were also assigned but are removed from categories-based analysis (the records are kept in the dataset when doing other kinds of analysis):\n\ninjury - description states something like “injury” or “injured” but gives no further information\nchronic - various physical impairments (eg “bent”, “deformed”, “ruptured”, “lame”) which might have been due to accidents but not enough info to be sure\nother - some descriptions like “accident” that are most likely relevant injuries but not specific enough to judge what kind\n\nA very few records which are almost certainly not relevant to the project (such as frostbite), probably not injuries or too fragmentary to interpret, are removed from the data before any analysis. (The “chronic” category is large enough that retaining it may be a bit problematic, but will keep it at least for now.)\n\n\nCode\n## shared packages etc ####\nsource(here::here(\"R/shared.R\")) \n## aesthetics ####\nsource(here::here(\"R/trimmings.R\"))\n\n# any extra packages and functions should go here\nlibrary(reactable)\n\n## dp data ####\ndp_injuries_xlsx &lt;-\n  read_excel(here::here(\"data/v20231130/dp_injury.xlsx\"), guess_max = 100000) |&gt;\n  rowid_to_column()\n\n# need locations for dp to fix lost-tbd\ndp_injury_category &lt;-\n  dp_injuries_xlsx |&gt;\n  select(rowid, injury, full_description, body_location) |&gt;\n  mutate(body_location=str_to_lower(body_location)) |&gt;\n  mutate(body_location=str_trim(str_replace_all(body_location, \"\\\\s\\\\s+\", \" \"))) |&gt;\n  mutate(injury_region = case_when(\n    str_detect(body_location, arm_rgx) ~ \"arm\",\n    str_detect(body_location, hand_rgx) ~ \"hand\",\n    str_detect(body_location, foot_rgx) ~ \"foot\",\n    str_detect(body_location, leg_rgx) ~ \"leg\",\n    str_detect(body_location, head_rgx) ~ \"head\",\n    str_detect(body_location, torso_rgx) ~ \"torso\",\n    body_location %in% c(\"side\", \"body\") ~ \"torso\",\n  )) |&gt;\n  # injury categories *after* region\n  mutate(injury = str_to_lower(injury)) |&gt;\n  mutate(injury = str_trim(str_replace_all(injury, \"  +\", \" \"))) |&gt;\n  # plural might be meaningful...\n  mutate(injury_plural = case_when(\n    str_detect(injury, \"\\\\b(marks)\\\\b|s$\") ~ \"y\"\n  )) |&gt;\n  # then slight std to make rgx easier. don't need to keep original.\n  mutate(injury = str_remove(injury, \"s$|^marks of *\")) |&gt;\n  injury_classify() |&gt;\n  ## tweak for injury category \"lost-tbd\". needs injury region\n  mutate(injury_category = case_when(\n    injury_region %in% c(\"foot\", \"hand\", \"leg\", \"arm\") & injury_category==\"lost-tbd\" ~ \"amputation\",\n    injury==\"lost sight\" ~ \"chronic\",\n    is.na(injury_region) & injury_category==\"lost-tbd\" ~ NA,\n    str_detect(body_location, \"teeth|tooth\") ~ NA,\n    # varied, includes eyes, ears, genitalia and less plausible locations but v few\n    injury_category==\"lost-tbd\" ~ \"other\", \n    .default = injury_category\n  )) \n\n## skeletons ####\nos_injury_xlsx &lt;-\n  read_excel(here::here(\"data/v20231130/os_injury.xlsx\") ) |&gt;\n  rowid_to_column()\n\nos_injury_category &lt;-\n  os_injury_xlsx |&gt;\n  separate(injury, into=c(\"injury\", \"i2\"), sep=\" *\\\\| *\", fill=\"right\", extra = \"merge\")  |&gt;\n  # tidy up\n  mutate(injury_category = str_remove(injury, \"\\\\..+$\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(injury_category = str_trim(str_to_lower(injury_category))) |&gt;\n  mutate(injury_category = case_when(\n    str_detect(injury_category, \"subluxation\") ~ \"dislocation\",\n    str_detect(injury_category, \"fracture|avulsion\") ~ \"fracture\",\n    injury_category==\"soft tissue trauma\" ~ \"muscle\",\n    str_detect(injury_category, \"projectile\") ~ \"wound\", # only one.\n    str_detect(injury_category, \"trauma\") ~ word(injury_category),\n    .default = injury_category\n  )) |&gt;\n  select(rowid, injury, injury_category)\n\n## hospitals ####\nhp_injury_xlsx &lt;-\n  read_excel(here::here(\"data/v20231130/hp_injury.xlsx\") , guess_max=18000) |&gt;\n  # basic year fixes\n  mutate(description_year = case_when(\n    description_year&gt;2000 ~ parse_number(str_sub(as.character(description_year), 2, 5)),\n    description_year&lt;1760 ~ NA, \n    .default=description_year\n  )) |&gt;\n  rowid_to_column()\n\nhp_injury_category &lt;-\n  hp_injury_xlsx |&gt;\n  select(rowid, injury, full_description) |&gt;\n  injury_classify()\n  \n\ninjuries_count &lt;-\nbind_rows(dp_injury_category, hp_injury_category, os_injury_category) |&gt;\n  mutate(injury = str_trim(str_to_lower(injury))) |&gt;\n  count(injury, name=\"count\") |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(injury)) |&gt;\n  mutate(rank= min_rank(desc(count))) |&gt;\n  relocate(rank)\n\n\nExplore injuries…"

    "text": "Assigning categories to the data\nA rules-based method using regular expressions is used to decide which category an injury description should be put in. The regex for the fractures category, for example, is: “fractur|broken|compound|avulsion|hairline|splintered)”\nThe process is not perfect, and some assignments can be more uncertain than others. “Scar”, for example, which is very common in DP descriptions, has been categorised as sharp force trauma as generally most likely, but scars can also be the result of burns. (If a description explicitly says that a scar was caused by burns, it’s put in the latter category instead.)\nDP also has a number of “lost X” (or “missing X”) and the most likely interpretation of these depends on the injury’s location. So, for example:\n\n“lost teeth/tooth” could be the result of an accident but seem far more likely to be related to poor dental health in this period and will be removed\na “lost” limb might not always be due to an accident, but on balance of probabilities will put in the “amputation” category\n\nThis is the function I eventually concocted to handle DP and HP (the regexes make it look complicated but the function itself is quite simple).

    "text": "Results\nAs already seen with injury location regions, the distribution of injury categories varies a lot between the collections. DP is dominated by sharp force injuries; many of these are scars, which reflects the nature of the DP records as recording long personal histories of physical misfortune and violence. OS is equally dominated by fractures, the injuries most likely to remain visible on skeletal evidence. HP, on the other hand, shows a more varied record of mishaps and accidents, though fractures are still the largest single category."

How did physical harm vary by gender, age, and occupation? And how did these patterns change between 1760 and 1901?\nHow do we classify and merge complex variables from social and osteoarchaeological datasets charting experiences of scarring and injury from skin (surface descriptions within hospital and criminal records) and bone (evidence of healed and/or healing trauma in skeletal remains)?\nHow can visualisations be utilised to summarise and analyse the complexity of this evidence, particularly when it is combined with evidence about the individual’s personal background and characteristics, in order to identify the specific contexts in which injuries, and what types of injuries, occurred?\nIn particular, can new data-mining and visualisation techniques be developed to uncover significant patterns in this and potentially other collections of complex, multivariate humanities data?"

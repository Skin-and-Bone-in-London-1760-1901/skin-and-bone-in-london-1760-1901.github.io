Injuries, accidents and interpersonal violence profoundly affected lived experiences of the body in England during this intense period of industrialisation.\nLed by a historian of the period with expertise in digital humanities, and an osteoarchaeologist who has collated data on trauma and injury in eighteenth-century bodies, the project has created a new open-access dataset, which this blog will document, explore and visualise."

Both HP and DP are based on transcriptions of documents written by people working in historical institutions (the hospital records were written by medical professionals; I’m not quite so sure about all the officials who recorded the DP descriptions). In contrast, the OS data has been recorded by a modern researcher using a systematic methodology for identifying and describing fractures [Mant, p.60].\nMost of the locations have been recorded twice, once using mostly non-technical language (“left forearm”) and then using more specific anatomical terms (“radius”). This gives me two chances to match a location to a region!

The body_location data is quite a bit messier than HP or OS, reflecting that the descriptions are more complex: injuries are more diverse than in the other two collections, and recording injuries wasn’t the records’ primary purpose so they can contain various kinds of information.\n\ndp_injury_locations |&gt;\n  distinct(full_description) |&gt;\n  slice(1:10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 1\n   full_description                                                             \n   &lt;chr&gt;                                                                        \n 1 Scar over right eye, mole on left shoulder.                                  \n 2 Scar right eye brow, mole on left shoulder, vaccination mark on left arm.    \n 3 Scar on forehead, left eyebrow & wrist, lost front upper tooth.              \n 4 Scar on forehead, 2 scar on right arm below the elbow and lost several teeth.\n 5 Scar on forehead and left of nose                                            \n 6 Scars on forehead and nose, ears pierced                                     \n 7 Scars on right knee, Ears pierced                                            \n 8 Scar on right knee                                                           \n 9 Scar on right hand and on forehead, mole on nose.                            \n10 Small Mole on left cheek, scar over left eyebrow, ears pierced               \n\n\nMost can be matched to the list; the exceptions needing some new additions to the list are variations in terminology (“forearm” or “collarbone”) or likely to be related to minor injuries that wouldn’t appear in hospital or skeleton records (“tooth/teeth”, “hair”).\nHowever, there are also more locations that can’t be placed, in particular “nail”, “bone” and “fore”, which are very likely to be due to extraction failures.

    "text": "Methodology\nThe technical challenge is to extract and classify detailed evidence from more than 87000 descriptions of individuals, including physical characteristics, bodily infirmities and personal details. The language used to describe injuries in the data is highly varied across the datasets, and it can be difficult to classify and standardise the nature of injury.\nThe amount of processing required (and the amount and kind of information available) varies among the datasets. The osteological data is already highly structured, and the hospital data partly so. However, the physical descriptions in Digital Panopticon datasets often consist of undifferentiated and fragmentary language which can include various physical attributes (eg heights, scars, tattoos and disabilities).\nThe relevant descriptive language needs to be identified, delineated and classified, but the datasets are too large in most cases for it to be feasible to mark them up manually. Instead, the project builds on automated techniques developed for the Criminal Tattoos project.\nOutline of the process:\n\ntokenisation of the text (ie, break into individual linguistic units eg words, punctuation) and then classify each token using a dictionary prepared by the project team, to assign a type to each token: injury type, body part, body specifier (left, right, upper, back of), cause of injury [where possible], stop word (anything unrelated to an injury, such as boil, pockmark, or mole), separator.\na simple grammatical rule set is applied to the text in order to assign individual injuries to the correct locations on the body. The rules-based approach is augmented by training a spaCy relation extraction deep learning model.\n\nThe process is not perfect. The original text of the descriptions is retained in the injuries tables for reference, and anyone using the data is advised to take some time to understand the data and its limitations."

It’s already very structured so it’s easy to work with. However, it includes a relatively limited range of injuries (mainly fractures), constrained to those that can be observed on the skeleton. There is also limited background information (we don’t know exactly when people were buried). Both age and sex are determined from the skeleton itself.\n\n\nHospital Records (HP)\nAdmission Registers:\n\nMiddlesex (1760-64, 1771-88), c.6000 individuals\nRoyal London (1760, 1791, 1792, 1805), c.4000 individuals\nGuy’s (1813-39), c.70000 individuals\nSt. Thomas’ (1773-6, 1781-9, 1790-9, 1800-9), c.30000 individuals\n\nNotes:\nThe registers vary considerably both in terms of their survival and the amount of detail they recorded. In the best cases, there is valuable data on length of hospital stay and outcomes, as well as ages and occupations. But the largest registers have much less detail than this. Moreover, by its nature the data only records injuries that were severe enough to necessitate hospitalisation (and descriptions only record the specific injuries that occasioned hospitalisation). There is no “uninjured” population for comparison.\n\n\nCriminal records (DP)\nThree datasets from the Digital Panopticon:\n\nMillbank Prison Register (1816-1828), c.500 individuals\nHome Office Prison Licenses (1853-1889), c.6000 individuals\nMetropolitan Police Habitual Criminal Register (1881-1901), c.55,000 individuals\n\nNotes:\nThese can be extraordinarily detailed documents of bodily experience, all the more valuable because they have been linked to extensive biographical and criminal histories. But, as noted, the varied language of the descriptions is highly challenging for computational analysis and there will be many (though hopefully mostly minor) errors and omissions in classification, so the data should be used with care."

    "text": "Results\nPie charts are a bit controversial. But I like them in certain cases. They’re also really easy to make in {ggplot}. Essentially, you start by making a bar chart and then turn it into a circle using the coord_polar() function.\n\nAge groups\nI opted to use a sequential colour scale, which I wouldn’t normally do for categorical data, but age groups are a special case (since they’re based on numerical data and do go from low to high).\nI’d like to have consistent colours for these categories across analyses. With ggplot, the easiest way to have complete control of colours is to use the scale_*_manual() functions, with a paired vector. I can include all five groups (plus unknown) and ggplot won’t mind if some aren’t actually in the data; it’ll only complain if there’s a value in the data that isn’t included in the vector.\n\ncol_age_groups5 &lt;- c(\n  \"0-17\"='#ffeda0', \n  \"18-25\"='#fecc5c', \n  \"26-35\"= '#fd8d3c', \n  \"36-45\"= '#fc4e2a', \n  \"46+\"= '#800026', \n  \"unknown\"='#dddddd'\n  )\n\nAs you might expect of data based on skeletons from cemeteries, the largest group is the oldest. (But the younger groups are nonetheless considerably larger than they would be in a modern cemetery.)\n\nos_injury_ages |&gt;\n  distinct(person_id, age_group) |&gt;\n  filter(age_group !=\"unknown\") |&gt;\n  count(age_group) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)*100) |&gt;\n  mutate(ypos = cumsum(prop)- 0.5*prop ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=\"\", y=prop, fill=age_group)) +\n  geom_col(width = 1, color=\"white\", show.legend = F) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = age_group), position = position_stack(vjust=0.5), color = \"white\", size=4) +\n  # make it circular\n  coord_polar(\"y\", start=0, direction = -1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = col_age_groups5) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(plot.tag.position = \"top\" ) +\n  labs(tag = \"OS age groups\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the three collections, the 46+ group is a lot smaller in both HP and DP; in both cases, the age groups are more evenly distributed than in OS. In HP 46+ is clearly still the single largest group. In DP the largest group is 26-35, with 18-25 close behind, so pie chart critics might point out it’s not obvious which is larger. But I’d argue that’s fine, because the difference (about 3%) is too small to really matter. What I want to do is get a quick overview and comparison of the three collections, and that’s what this is good at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\nOnly OS has a significant proportion of unknowns. What’s most noticeable is that women are in the minority in all three collections - this would be expected in criminal datasets, but is more surprising in the other two."

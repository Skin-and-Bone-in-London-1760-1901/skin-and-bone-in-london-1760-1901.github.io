    "text": "This project explores the possibilities of studying the impact of industrialisation and urbanisation on the material human body by combining methodologies from three disparate but related disciplines: Osteoarchaeology, History, and Digital Humanities. Skin and Bone seeks to chart the embodied experience of work-related injury, accidents, and interpersonal violence of c.170,000 Londoners during the Industrial Revolution.\nLed by a historian of the period, with expertise in digital humanities, and an osteoarchaeologist who has collated data on trauma and injury in eighteenth-century bodies, the project will generate a new open-access multivariate database and develop innovative approaches to studying and visualising the historic material body - skin and bone - in London during the Industrial Revolution.\nIn both archaeology and history, the period 1760-1901 represents a significant transformation for the body. Osteoarchaeological scholarship has increasingly examined the negative impacts of the process of industrialisation; the accompanying large migration from rural to urban environments transformed human demographics with wide-ranging impacts upon human health. Historians, too, have discussed the impact of industrialisation on the body, specifically how new urban contexts damaged life expectancy while also changing attitudes to bodies that defined new social identities and social relationships, notably a new class of poor labouring bodies and hardening concepts of the able and disabled body.\nInjuries, accidents and interpersonal violence profoundly affected lived experiences of the body in England during the intense period of industrialisation between 1760 and 1901. Osteoarchaeological trauma analysis (fractures, repetitive movement injuries, and dislocations) can provide important data on work-related risk, accident, and medical interventions, yet cannot alone show how these physical features affected social lives and identities.\nOsteoarchaeology datasets in combination with hospital and criminal justice records, which note age, gender and occupation alongside many bodily features (such as deformities and scars), provide a means of accessing and contextualising embodied experiences of industrialising London, but this information is currently held within disparate datasets.\nThe project will merge ten datasets compiled from criminal, hospital, and osteoarchaeological records to explore the relationships between trauma, injury, and accidents with social demographics, but especially, sex/gender, age and occupational status. The first technical challenge is to extract and classify detailed evidence on over 170,000 individuals, including their physical characteristics, bodily infirmities and personal details. The language used to describe injuries in the data is highly varied across the datasets, and it can be difficult to classify and standardise the nature of injury. In addition to the challenge of merging, extracting and classifying the data, a second technical challenge exists in coping with the complexity of the multiple variables available and in summarising such diverse data. In order to deal with this complexity, and examine the links between the datasets, new visualisations need to be developed to summarise this multivariate data."

    "text": "This project explores the possibilities of studying the impact of industrialisation and urbanisation on the material human body by combining methodologies from three disparate but related disciplines: Osteoarchaeology, History, and Digital Humanities. Skin and Bone seeks to chart the embodied experience of work-related injury, accidents, and interpersonal violence of 173, 366 Londoners during the Industrial Revolution, 1760-1901.\nTo do this, the project will merge ten disparate datasets compiled from criminal, hospital, and osteoarchaeological records to explore the relationships between trauma, injury, and accidents with social demographics, but especially, sex/gender, age and occupational status.\nLed by a historian of the period, with expertise in digital humanities, and an osteoarchaeologist who has collated data on trauma and injury in eighteenth-century bodies, the project will generate a new open-access multivariate database and develop innovative approaches to studying and visualising the historic material body - skin and bone - in London during the Industrial Revolution."

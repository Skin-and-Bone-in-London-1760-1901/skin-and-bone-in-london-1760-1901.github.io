This is a data blog for the **Skin and Bone** project, which seeks to chart the embodied experience of work-related injury, accidents, and interpersonal violence of c.50,000 Londoners during the Industrial Revolution. 

In both archaeology and history, the period 1760-1901 represents a significant transformation for the body. Injuries, accidents and interpersonal violence profoundly affected lived experiences of the body in England during this intense period of industrialisation. 

Led by a historian of the period with expertise in digital humanities, and an osteoarchaeologist who has collated data on trauma and injury in eighteenth-century bodies, the project has created a new open-access [dataset](https://www.dhi.ac.uk/data/skin-and-bone), which this blog will document, explore and visualise.

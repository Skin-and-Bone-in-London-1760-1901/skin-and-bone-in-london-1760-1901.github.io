This project explores the possibilities of studying the impact of industrialisation and urbanisation on the material human body by combining methodologies from three disparate but related disciplines: Osteoarchaeology, History, and Digital Humanities. Skin and Bone seeks to chart the embodied experience of work-related injury, accidents, and interpersonal violence of 173, 366 Londoners during the Industrial Revolution, 1760-1901. 

To do this, the project will merge ten disparate datasets compiled from criminal, hospital, and osteoarchaeological records to explore the relationships between trauma, injury, and accidents with social demographics, but especially, sex/gender, age and occupational status. 

Led by a historian of the period, with expertise in digital humanities, and an osteoarchaeologist who has collated data on trauma and injury in eighteenth-century bodies, the project will generate a new open-access multivariate database and develop innovative approaches to studying and visualising the historic material body - skin and bone - in London during the Industrial Revolution.
